        "Movies are one of the most prominent forms of media in the entertainment industry. The domestic film industry amassed a total of $5.99 billion USD in 2022 [Elad 2023]. This significant financial success reflects the widespread appeal and consumption of movies by audiences worldwide. While recent trends indicate a noticeable shift in viewership from traditional box office releases to home entertainment options like streaming platforms, the film industry continues to flourish. Movies are consistently being released to cater to the diverse tastes and preferences of audiences, offering a vast array of options to choose from. This raises an intriguing question regarding the specific elements of movies or the filmmaking process that contribute to improved box office performance or higher overall ratings, as evaluated by diverse movie rating websites.\n",

        "There has been prior work done on the topic of what makes a movie successful, in which the paper explores the increasing use of predictive analytics in the movie industry to forecast box office earnings, building upon prior research on the determinants of movie success. It delves into the process of estimating potential movie earnings by taking into account various factors such as budget, genre, top-billed star, and release timing. The study demonstrates the application of different predictive analysis techniques, including a vanilla partition model, random forest model, boosted tree model, support vector machine model, XG Boost model, and R part model, to showcase the effectiveness of data analysis in predicting financial success. Among the employed models, the random forest model emerged as the most accurate [Joseph 2019]. By acknowledging this finding, we can incorporate the insights gained from the paper's research to enhance the accuracy of our own analysis.\n",
